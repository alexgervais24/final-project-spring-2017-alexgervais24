		<h1>Alex Gervais</h1>
		<p>Hello my name is Alex. I am a fifth grader at Martha Jones school in Mr. Parkhurst's class. My birthday is January 9th 2006. I really like polotics, science, history, math, art, and engineering. I know two code languges, Scratch and HTML, and I am taking a class for HTML right now. That's a little bit about me.  </p>
